# Structural Modeling of Disease Variants

This folder documents structural modeling of cardiac and ion channel protein variants using deep learning-based prediction tools.

## ðŸ§¬ Tools Used
- **AlphaFold2** â€” Prediction of wild-type and variant protein structures
- **RoseTTAFold** â€” Secondary modeling for benchmarking
- **ChimeraX / PyMOL** â€” Visualizing mutation sites, structural deviation
- **Missense3D / DynaMut** â€” Predicting structural impacts of point mutations
