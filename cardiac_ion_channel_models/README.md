# Cardiac Ion Channel Models

This folder documents the modeling and structural analysis of cardiac ion channels (e.g., hERG, Nav1.5, Cav1.2).

## 🔬 Tools Used
- **AlphaFold2** — Predicting full-length and truncated ion channel structures
- **PDB mining** — Using templates for model refinement
- **ChimeraX** — Domain labeling, electrostatic surface, and binding site inspection
- **MDTools (MDTraj + GROMACS)** — Analyzing gating dynamics

## 📁 Contents
| File/Subfolder | Description |
