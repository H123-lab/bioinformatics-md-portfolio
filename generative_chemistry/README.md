# Generative Chemistry for Drug Discovery

This folder includes workflows and outputs from using AI-based models to generate novel compounds targeting cardiac proteins.

## ðŸ§ª Tools Used
- **DeepChem** â€” Compound generation and activity prediction
- **RDKit** â€” Molecule structure generation, fingerprinting
- **AutoDock Vina** â€” Docking generated ligands to hERG/Nav1.5
- **MolGAN / ChemProp (planned)** â€” Testing graph-based generative models
