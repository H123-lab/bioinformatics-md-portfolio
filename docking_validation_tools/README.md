# Docking Validation Tools

This folder documents tools used for post-docking interaction validation and visualization of ligand-protein complexes.

## ðŸ§ª Tools Used
- **PLIP (Protein-Ligand Interaction Profiler)** â€” Automated detection of hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic contacts, salt bridges, Ï€-stacking, and metal interactions.
- **LigPlot+** â€” 2D interaction diagrams showing key binding site interactions.
- **PyMOL/ChimeraX** â€” 3D structure inspection, hydrogen bond visualization, and publication-ready rendering.

## ðŸ§¾ Typical Output Files
| File/Subfolder | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `ligplot_diagrams/` | Auto-generated 2D diagrams for each compound |
| `plip_reports/` | Text + image reports of ligand-residue interactions |
| `hydrogen_bond_stats.csv` | Quantitative analysis of H-bonds across MD frames |
| `rendered_figures/` | Clean images for supplementary figures |

## ðŸ’¡ Skills Demonstrated
- Interaction fingerprint analysis
- Evaluation of docking reliability
- Comparative visualization of binding interactions
